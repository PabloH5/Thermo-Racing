# Thermo Racing: Multimedia System for Supporting Learning of Thermodynamics

Thermo Racing is an interactive multimedia system designed to aid engineering students in mastering the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Developed by a team from Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, this system utilizes gamification and real-time calculations to provide an engaging and practical learning experience through mini-games and competitive Go-Kart racing scenarios.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary goal of Thermo Racing is to help students understand and apply the first and second laws of thermodynamics through interactive activities, thereby addressing the common difficulties students face in this subject.

### Key Features
1. **Interactive Mini-Games**: Focus on practical applications of thermodynamic principles within the context of Go-Kart racing.
2. **Go-Kart Racing Mode**: Competitive racing that incorporates thermodynamics questions to reinforce learning.
3. **Customization**: Players can customize their Go-Karts, earning new parts through successful completion of mini-games and races.
4. **Multiplayer Functionality**: Encourages healthy competition among students.

## Development Process

### Methodology
The development followed the pre-production method of multimedia systems, which involves several stages to ensure the final product meets the stakeholders' needs:

1. **Genesis Route**: Identification of target audience and their needs through stakeholder mapping, empathy maps, and trend analysis.
2. **Creative Route**: Brainstorming sessions and innovative concepts to design the solution, resulting in an Interactive Multimedia Experience (IME).
3. **Responsible Route**: Ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and considering social, economic, and environmental impacts.
4. **Assurance Route**: Evaluating the technical and commercial feasibility, identifying risks, and planning for contingencies.
5. **Agility Route**: Agile development approach with continuous feedback and refinement.
6. **Specification Route**: Defining detailed features and functionalities through user stories and prioritizing them for development.

## Features and Gameplay

### Mini-Games
1. **"A Revisar las Llantas"**: Focuses on the first law of thermodynamics through practical exercises.
2. **Thermo-Ecuacionador**: Reinforces the second law of thermodynamics with timed questions and interactive equations.

### Go-Kart Racing
- **Solo Mode**: Players race against CPU-driven vehicles, answering thermodynamics questions to progress.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Competitive racing with other students to enhance engagement and learning.

### Customization
Players earn cosmetic upgrades for their Go-Karts by completing mini-games and races, adding a personalized and motivating element to the learning process.

## Validation and Feedback

Throughout development, feedback was gathered from both students and professors to ensure the system effectively addresses the learning challenges associated with thermodynamics. Positive responses highlighted the engaging nature of the mini-games and the practical application of thermodynamic concepts.

## Limitations and Future Work

The pre-production phase was limited to four months, and the production phase will continue for another four months. Future work will focus on refining the system, expanding functionalities, and conducting extensive usability testing to ensure the system meets educational goals.

## Conclusion

Thermo Racing aims to provide an effective, engaging, and practical tool for learning the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Through its innovative use of gamification and interactive elements, it addresses key learning challenges and enhances students' understanding and application of these critical concepts.
